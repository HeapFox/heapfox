# HeapFox Trademark & Brand Policy

This policy clarifies how HeapFox trademarks, logos, names, and distinctive brand elements may be used in connection with the open-source software in this repository.

## Summary

- The source code is open-source under the LICENSE at the repo root (Apache-2.0), but brand assets are NOT covered by that license.
- You may self-host the software and keep the HeapFox name and logo in your own deployments.
- If you operate a hosted service for third parties (e.g., a commercial or public SaaS offering) based on this software, you MUST remove HeapFox brand elements and any confusingly similar UI (logos, word marks, proprietary icons, and distinctive styles that imply official affiliation).
- Do not use the HeapFox name in your domain, company name, product name, or advertising in a way that implies official endorsement or partnership without prior written permission.

## Allowed Uses

- Personal or internal deployments may retain HeapFox branding.
- Educational content may use the HeapFox name descriptively (e.g., "Tutorial using HeapFox Docs").
- Forks and derivative works may reference the original project in acknowledgements and documentation.

## Restricted Uses

- Public/third-party hosted services derived from this code must remove HeapFox branding, including but not limited to:
  - Logos, iconography, and the "HeapFox" word mark
  - Proprietary visual treatments unique to HeapFox (e.g., custom logo component and brand-specific UI motifs)
  - Any presentation that could reasonably cause confusion as to source, sponsorship, or endorsement
- You may not register domain names, social media handles, or app/package names that include or are confusingly similar to "HeapFox" without permission.

## UI and Component Guidance

- If your deployment is a public service: replace the logo component, update color tokens and brand-specific components, and remove references to HeapFox Docs in copy.
- You may state factual attribution in a footer or about page (e.g., "Forked from HeapFox Docs"), provided there is no suggestion of endorsement.
